                    <p>Upper Lake, also known as Bhojtal or Bada Talab, is a prominent freshwater lake located in the heart of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Believed to have been created in the 11th century by Raja Bhoj, the lake spans over 30 square kilometers and plays a vital role in supplying drinking water to the city. Surrounded by lush greenery, including Van Vihar National Park, and bordered by cultural landmarks and recreational spots, the lake offers a peaceful escape from the urban bustle. It also supports activities like boating and sightseeing, making it a popular destination for both locals and tourists. Despite facing environmental concerns such as pollution and encroachment, efforts are ongoing to preserve its ecological balance. Upper Lake remains a symbol of Bhopal's historical legacy, environmental importance, and natural charm.</p>
